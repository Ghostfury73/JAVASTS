1) time complexity is directly protpotional to the input n and we call this a linear relation
2) time complecity 
    best case = Ω(n)
    average case = θ(n+1/2)
    worst case = O(n)
 note  keep in mind when we talk about the time complexity we alwasys consider the worst case
 cause we know no matter what time cannot pass this worst case complexity so for making the algorithum
 better we will consider the upper case and improve it up....
